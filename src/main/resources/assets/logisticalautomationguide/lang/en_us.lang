#Conveyors Master Entry Text
guide.logisticalautomation.entry.conveyors.intro.info=Conveyors are complex mechanisms used for transporting items, blocks, and even creatures around the world.
guide.logisticalautomation.entry.conveyors.normal.info=Normal Conveyors are conveyors which move items, blocks, and creatures horizontally on the ground.
guide.logisticalautomation.entry.conveyors.vertical.info=Vertical Conveyors are conveyors which move items, blocks, and creatures vertically upwards.
guide.logisticalautomation.entry.conveyors.stair.info=Escalators are conveyors which are stair-shaped and move items, blocks, and creatures diagonally upwards.
guide.logisticalautomation.entry.conveyors.filters.info=The Filter is a complex machine used for moving items and blocks of certain types in your chosen direction.
guide.logisticalautomation.entry.conveyors.alternators.info=The Alternator is a simple machine which alternates the direction of any items (up to a stack of 64) which are inserted.
guide.logisticalautomation.entry.conveyors.junctions.info=The Junction is an improved Alternator which lets you control its direction via redstone.
guide.logisticalautomation.entry.conveyors.splitters.info=The Splitter is an upgraded Alternator that cuts each stack which enters it in half outputs them on opposite sides. (Note: If the stack is odd in size, the bigger half always comes out on the right)
guide.logisticalautomation.entry.conveyors.blowtorches.info=The Blowtorch is a flamethrower which does three hearts of damage to the creature in front of it every two seconds.
guide.logisticalautomation.entry.conveyors.poly_blowtorches.info=The Polydirectional Blowtorch is an upgraded Blowtorch which does three hearts of damage to every single creature around it every two seconds.
guide.logisticalautomation.entry.conveyors.grates.info=The Grate is a simple block that let's small non-living entities pass through it while open. It can be controlled both by hand or via redstone.
